					I do semi-professional video making (like Kickstarter videos) as a hobby, you can check out some of my stuff here. I really like putting together

						(like game design).

						have a career in game development contributing to either a really meaningful game (like Life is Strange) or a really fun game (like Borderlands 2).
						I haven't figured whether I want to try an walk the AAA studio route, the indie route or somewhere in the middle, we'll see!

			<div class="QA">
				<div class="question">
					What is your favorite colour?
				</div>

			<div class="QA">
				<div class="question">
					Would you like to be famous?
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					Excellent question, I'm actually pretty indifferent to being famous. There are a lot of things I would like to do in life and 
						whether or not they made me famous has nothing to do with why I want to do them so if I achieve my goals, and end up famous, cool! 
						If I achieve my goals and don’t become famous, cool!
