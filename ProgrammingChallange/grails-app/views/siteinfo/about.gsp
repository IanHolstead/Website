			<div class="QA">
				<div class="question">
					What do you do in your spare time?
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					I have spare time?!? Awesome! Where do I get it? (Just kidding. Sorta.) When I have a chance I enjoy programming, 
					playing video games, getting out to exercise, traveling and socializing with my friends. 
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="QA">
				<div class="question">
					Where do you hope to be in 5 years?
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<a href="http://xkcd.com/1088/" target="_blank">Lets find out!</a> I hope to be working full time for a really cool tech company (like Google or Valve). Acknowledging that it’s a long shot its good to aim high! (right?). In the simplest form, I want to work for a company which has tight deadlines and that you can really make a difference by working harder. I'm always amazed how much I can get done when I'm under pressure and I love being able to make something better by working more at it.

			<div class="QA">
				<div class="question">
					Your website looks great! Can I hire you for web design?
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					Thanks, I'm flattered, but no. I am much more experienced in backend programming and most of the front end on my website was created by the twitter bootstrap. However I do know some people who are amazing, if you send me a note I can help you get in touch. If you are looking for a developer who can learn quickly with experience in C#, Java, Groovy and Lua send me a note!

			<div class="QA">
				<div class="question">
					What’s your favorite book(s)?
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					I am a huge fan of the inheritance cycle (specifically Inheritance) but I also thoroughly enjoyed the entire Harry Potter series (Half Blood Prince was the best of the series). 
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="QA">
				<div class="question">
					What’s your favorite movie(s)?
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					I was completely blown away when I saw Avatar for the first time; and the next 10 times after that. All and all a great movie. More recently I found myself loving Frozen (the Disney movie). Also on this list: all Lord of the Rings movies, How to Train your Dragon, Inception and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.

			<div class="QA">
				<div class="question">
					Tell me something cool!

			<div class="QA">
				<div class="question">
					What is the averaged airspeed of an unladen swallow?
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=estimated+average+cruising+airspeed+of+an+unladen+african+swallow " target="_blank">African</a> or <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=estimated+average+cruising+airspeed+of+an+unladen+European+swallow " target="_blank">European</a>? 11 m/s if European but there is insufficient data to know for certain about African swallows (even if you specified which of the 47 species you were wanting to know about).  
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="QA">
				<div class="question">
					What is your favorite colour?
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					Black! And for those bastards which argue black isn’t a colour: black -> blue, anything in that spectrum is good.
